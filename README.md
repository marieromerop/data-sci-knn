# data-sci-knn

Hello, 

This repository is for resume purposes. This is to display my previous work in the domain of data science via my previous courses.
Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of these files/ideas. The html and pdf files are for ease of view in what 
i've done if you do not have easy access to a virtual environment like jupyter notebook or google colab that can run python notebook files.

This project focused on practicing K-nearest-neighbours. 

Best, Eugenia
